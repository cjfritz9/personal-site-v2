This API was developed on a Node.js server that used a combination of worker threads and instance scaling to handle large amounts of traffic and request concurrency. This software automatically let users know if the product they were viewing was compatible with their zone. The application had a fallback state that allowed users to find their own USDA grow zone if it encountered any issues (VPNs, application errors, etc.). This software handled tens of thousands of requests per day and never encountered any errors due to major testing before production and the simplicity of the pipeline.",

Overall this software improved the quality of all product photos, reduced their file sizes, and produced all images in a universal aspect ratio.",
